                    <p>
                        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems, obtained from the Federal Institute of Northern Minas 
                        Gerais - Campus Arinos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my academic journey, I have demonstrated a high level of engagement and participation, 
                        actively involving myself in various academic projects. From the very beginning, I recognized the 
                        importance of expanding my knowledge beyond the confines of the classroom and applying what I have 
                        learned in practical settings. As a result, I engaged in research projects, participated in software 
                        development teams, offered tutoring at the university, and even pursued supplementary courses to enhance 
                        my skills based on my perceived needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During my professional career, I have developed solid skills in Java programming language and its 
                        ecosystem through my role as a backend developer in a renowned financial institution, PagBank.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Currently, I hold the position of native Android mobile developer, utilizing Kotlin, where I have been 
                        expanding and enhancing my professional competencies while leveraging the knowledge acquired previously. 
                        I would like to highlight my involvement in highly successful projects that have yielded notable outcomes, 
                        such as reducing the size of an application from 617MB to 26MB and being awarded the Best App of the Year 
                        by the Play Store. This particular project was aimed at the children's audience, encompassing a platform 
                        for streaming and children's games.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Presently, I am directing my focus towards the financial sector, working for one of the leading banks in 
                        Brazil.
